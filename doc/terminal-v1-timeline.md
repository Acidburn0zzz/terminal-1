# Terminal v1.0 Timeline

## Overview

In the 4 months since we [announced and open-sourced Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/), the team has delivered 4 releases [via the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701), each incrementally improving the Terminal's user experience, stability, performance, and features. 

We've also been figuring out a project velocity that allows us to deliver new Terminal builds on a predictable cadence, which we're documenting here for those interested in our processes.

## Milestones

The Windows Terminal project is engineered and delivered as a set of monthly ~4-week milestones:

| Duration | Activity | Releases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 weeks | Dev <br/> <ul><li>Fixes / Features for future Windows Releases</li><li>Fixes / Features for Windows Terminal</li></ul> |  Release to Internal Selfhosters at end of week 2 |
| 1 week | Quality <br/> <ul><li>Bug Fixes</li><li>Perf & Stability</li><li>UI Polish</li><li>Tests</li><li>etc.</li></ul>| Release to Microsoft Store at end of week 3 |

> Th few 5 week milestones get an additional week of dev time in which to build more features and/or fix more bugs!
